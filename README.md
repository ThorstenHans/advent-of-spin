# Fermyon Advent of Spin

We understand that learning a new technology can be a little daunting, as there’s a lot of buzz around many new technologies and it can be hard to understand which deserve your attention.

We’re really excited by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) on a server and believe that writing your micro-services as [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) components provides a developer experience, locally and in the cloud, that far surpasses what we’ve become accustomed too over the last decade.

Providing just enough glue to allow you to focus on your domain and business logic, Spin simplifies the promise of building event driven architectures.

We want to help you find your footing with Spin and WebAssembly with a fun and effective process that doesn’t require reading, watching, or listening to hours upon hours of content. We built Spin to make things easier, and we want to show you that with our Fermyon's Advent of Spin.

While our Advent of Spin takes on some characteristics of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), ours is not meant to test your algorithms, data structures, or mathematical genius; instead, we want to provide you the opportunity each week to spend a litte bit of time writing and deploying your own Spin applications.

We’ll update this repository every Tuesday in December with a fun scenario for you to learn how to write your first WebAssembly applications.

If you’re unsure of any exercise, we will go over a solution and present next weeks challenge in our weekly Live Code Tuesday on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@FermyonTech).

We’ll also be providing awards for across a few bespoke categories and your solutions could win you some fantastic swag, so don’t forget to read the submission guidelines for each challenge and submit your solution.
